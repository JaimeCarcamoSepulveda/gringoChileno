                    which is ${carType.liters} in liters. Current gas prices are ${literPrice} 
                    which means you will need ${carType.liters*literPrice} in Chilean currency.

                <p>just like in the U.S. tips are complimentary however they are 10% rate by custom. </p>
                <p> time does not reset after 12 (noon) it is expressed in military-time style. ex. 7pm is 19 hours. </p>
                <p>Expect to pay 500 CLP to go to the restroom and almost ALL public restrooms. Exceptions apply 
                    if it is a restaurant in which you are eating. If you are in Santiago—or a big city — 
                    you can even expect to be handed a toilet paper amount while going in—I know this was a culture-shock to me as well. </p>
                <p>Public transportation is actually used in Chile, so if you do travel through those means be sure to have coins handy. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>133 is the equivalent of 911</li>
                    <li>132 is number for  fire station</li>
                    <li>131 is phone number for ambulance</li>
                </ul>
                <P>You may also come across firefighters asking for money, this is because in Chile they are volunteers and receive
                     limited funding by the state therefore they depend on money that is donated or fundraised —I know, I was shocked as well. 
                </P>
                <P>if you have a fever note that it will be measured in celsius not fahrenheit (refer to fahrenheit to celsius calculator)</P>
                <P>When you greet someone they may get a kiss on the cheek. Don’t jump to conclusions this is customary although it is something 
                    that has been fading out with the younger generation.</P>
